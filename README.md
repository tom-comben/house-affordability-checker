WIP

Currently rewriting my Angular project (not on Github) as a React project

Most functionality from the previous project has been transferred over, as well as map zooming/panning

Due to the way the data is currently mocked, changing the property types in the menu has no effect

TODO:

ADD TESTING!!!

Fix API integration to work with this project (rewrite API to make more usable/flexible)

Once fixed, Find a better way to mock the data/database

Transfer information window popping up when a region is clicked from the old project

Add advanced search settings for more customised searches (e.g. mortgage parameters and freehold/leasehold)

Think of a better name
