WIP
Currently rewriting my Angular project (not on Github) as a React project
Most functionality from the previous project has been transferred over, as well as map zooming/panning
Due to the way the data is currently mocked, changing the property types in the menu has no effect

TODO:
ADD TESTING!!!
Fix API integration to work with this project (rewrite API to make more usable/flexible)
Once fixed, Find a better way to mock the data/database
Transfer information window popping up when a region is clicked from the old project
Fix regions that don't colour properly
Fix regions that aren't quite lined up in the SVG
Add advanced search settings for more customised searches (e.g. mortgage parameters and freehold/leasehold)
Think of a better name
