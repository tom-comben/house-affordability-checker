WIP

Most functionality from the previous project has been transferred over, as well as map zooming/panning

If no .env file is present, mock data is used instead of querying the database.

If mock data is used, changing the property types field has no effect due to the way the data is mocked

TODO:

add more tests

Transfer information window popping up when a region is clicked from the old project

Add advanced search settings for more customised searches (e.g. mortgage parameters and freehold/leasehold)

Improve UI

Think of a better name
